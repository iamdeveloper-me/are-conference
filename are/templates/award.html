        <p>From worsening climate and environmental conditions, it is clear that probably we are not taking enough corrective actions. But there are odd individuals, organisations and government bodies out there, who are actually taking significant actions and having brilliant ideas to save the world from catastrophic effects of climate change. Energy Swaraj Foundation is launching AMG (Avoid-Minimise-Generate) Awards as well as Climate Hackathon Challenge - ideas and actions to save the world to recognize citizenâ€™s contributions, encourage them and provide them limelight so that they can spread their actions and ideas.</p>
